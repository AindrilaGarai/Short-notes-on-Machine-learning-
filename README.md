  This repository contains the learning notes that I have prepared during a Winter Reading Project on Statistical Machine Learning done under the guidance of [Dr. Tanujit Chakraborty](https://www.ctanujit.org/) at Sorbonne Universitè (remote internship).

  Each and every folder contains the reading notes and codes of the topics that I have learned from ISLR Book [1] and ESLR Book [2] during this reading project.
